# cranelift

Cranelift is a fast, secure code generator designed as a backend for WebAssembly and programming language implementations. Unlike traditional compiler backends like LLVM, Cranelift prioritizes compilation speed and simplicity over maximum runtime performance, making it ideal for JIT compilation scenarios. The library provides a complete infrastructure for generating machine code from a low-level intermediate representation, handling register allocation, instruction selection, and machine code emission across multiple architectures.

The core design philosophy of Cranelift centers on predictable compilation time and memory usage. It achieves fast compilation through a streamlined architecture that avoids expensive optimization passes, while still producing reasonably efficient code. This makes Cranelift particularly suitable for scenarios where compilation happens at runtime, such as WebAssembly engines, database query compilers, and language virtual machines.

## Core Architecture

```rust
#![struct!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", JitCompiler)]
```

The JitCompiler structure encapsulates the Cranelift compilation pipeline. The builder context maintains state across function compilations, the module context holds the intermediate representation, and the JITModule manages the generated machine code and symbol resolution.

```rust
#![function!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", JitCompiler::new)]
```

Initialization configures the target architecture and compilation settings. The ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) builder automatically detects the host CPU features, while settings control trade-offs between compilation speed and code quality. The symbol lookup function enables linking to external functions, crucial for runtime library calls.

## Function Compilation

```rust
#![function!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", JitCompiler::compile_function)]
```

Function compilation transforms high-level operations into machine code through several phases. The FunctionBuilder provides a convenient API for constructing the control flow graph and instruction sequences. Variable management connects high-level variables to SSA values, while block sealing enables efficient phi node insertion. The verification step ensures the generated IR satisfies Cranelift's invariants before code generation.

## Instruction Building

```rust
#![function!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", compile_add_function)]
```

Simple arithmetic operations demonstrate the instruction builder interface. Variables provide a high-level abstraction over SSA values, automatically handling phi nodes at control flow merge points. The return instruction explicitly specifies which values to return, supporting multiple return values naturally.

## Control Flow

```rust
#![function!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", compile_factorial)]
```

Loop construction requires explicit block management and parameter passing. Block parameters implement SSA form, making data flow explicit at control flow joins. The seal operation indicates when all predecessors of a block are known, enabling efficient phi node insertion. Conditional branches carry arguments for the taken branch, implementing a form of conditional move at the IR level.

```rust
#![function!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", compile_fibonacci)]
```

The Fibonacci implementation demonstrates iterative computation with loop-carried dependencies. The loop structure uses block parameters to maintain loop variables without mutable state. This SSA-based approach enables straightforward optimization and register allocation.

## Floating Point Operations

```rust
#![function!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", compile_quadratic)]
```

Floating point arithmetic follows IEEE 754 semantics with explicit operation chains. The instruction builder maintains type safety, preventing mixing of integer and floating point operations. Compound expressions decompose into primitive operations, exposing optimization opportunities to the code generator.

## External Function Calls

```rust
#![function!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", compile_with_print)]
```

External function integration enables interaction with the runtime environment. Function declarations specify the calling convention and signature, while the import linkage indicates external resolution. The module system manages cross-function references, supporting both ahead-of-time and just-in-time linking models.

## Memory Operations

```rust
#![function!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", compile_sum_array)]
```

Memory access demonstrates pointer arithmetic and load operations. MemFlags specify aliasing and alignment properties, enabling optimization while maintaining correctness. The explicit pointer increment reflects the low-level nature of Cranelift IR, providing direct control over memory access patterns.

## Expression Trees

```rust
#![enum!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", Expr)]
```

The expression enumeration represents abstract syntax trees for compilation. This recursive structure maps naturally to Cranelift's instruction builder API.

```rust
#![impl!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", Expr)]
```

Recursive compilation transforms expression trees into SSA values. The method directly maps expression nodes to Cranelift instructions, demonstrating the correspondence between high-level operations and low-level IR. Variable references connect to the function's parameter space, enabling parameterized expression evaluation.

## Symbol Management

```rust
#![struct!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", SymbolTable)]
```

Symbol tables manage the mapping between names and Cranelift variables. The monotonic variable allocation ensures unique SSA names throughout compilation.

```rust
#![function!("cranelift/src/lib.rs", SymbolTable::declare)]
```

Variable declaration combines allocation with type specification. The builder's declare_var call registers the variable in the function's metadata, enabling the use_var and def_var operations that connect high-level variables to SSA values.

## Optimization Considerations

Cranelift performs several optimizations during code generation despite prioritizing compilation speed. The instruction combiner merges adjacent operations when beneficial, such as combining additions with small constants into immediate-mode instructions. Simple dead code elimination removes unreachable blocks and unused values.

Register allocation uses a fast linear scan algorithm that produces good code without the compilation time cost of graph coloring or PBQP approaches. The allocator handles live range splitting and spilling automatically, generating reload code as needed.

The code generator exploits CPU features when available, using vector instructions for appropriate operations and conditional moves to avoid branches. Target-specific optimizations include addressing mode selection and instruction scheduling within basic blocks.

## Integration Patterns

Cranelift integrates into larger systems through several abstraction layers. The Module trait provides a uniform interface for both JIT and AOT compilation, abstracting over linking and symbol resolution differences. The cranelift-wasm crate demonstrates translation from WebAssembly to Cranelift IR, while maintaining semantic equivalence.

Runtime code generation benefits from Cranelift's incremental compilation model. Functions can be compiled on-demand, with lazy linking deferring symbol resolution until needed. The JIT module supports code invalidation and recompilation, essential for adaptive optimization systems.

Debugging support includes source location tracking through the IR pipeline, enabling accurate debugging information in generated code. The cranelift-reader crate provides a textual IR format for testing and debugging, while the verifier catches IR inconsistencies early in development.

## Performance Characteristics

Compilation speed typically ranges from 10-100 MB/s of generated code, orders of magnitude faster than optimizing compilers. Memory usage scales linearly with function size, avoiding the exponential growth of some optimization algorithms. The generated code typically performs within 2-3x of optimized C code, acceptable for many JIT scenarios.

Cranelift's architecture enables predictable performance across different input programs. The lack of iterative optimization passes ensures bounded compilation time, while the streaming code generation minimizes memory residence. These properties make Cranelift suitable for latency-sensitive applications where compilation happens on the critical path.

## Error Handling

The verifier catches most IR construction errors before code generation, providing clear diagnostics about invalid instruction sequences or type mismatches. Runtime errors manifest as traps, with preservation of source location information for debugging. The compilation pipeline propagates errors explicitly, avoiding panics in production use.

## Best Practices

Structure IR generation to minimize variable live ranges, reducing register pressure and improving code quality. Use block parameters instead of variables for values that cross block boundaries, enabling better optimization. Seal blocks as soon as all predecessors are known to enable efficient SSA construction.

Profile compilation time to identify bottlenecks, particularly in function builder usage patterns. Large functions may benefit from splitting into smaller units that compile independently. Consider caching compiled code when possible to amortize compilation costs across multiple executions.

Design the IR generation to preserve high-level semantics where possible. Cranelift's optimizer works best when the intent of operations is clear, such as using specific instructions for bounds checks rather than generic comparisons.

The combination of fast compilation, reasonable code quality, and production-ready robustness makes Cranelift an excellent choice for JIT compilation scenarios. Its clean API and predictable performance characteristics simplify integration into language implementations while providing sufficient performance for real-world applications.
