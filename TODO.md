- [x] syn                 Turns Rust source into an abstract syntax tree (AST); indispensable for procedural-macro–style front-ends.
- [x] quote               Generates Rust code from templates ("quasi-quoting"), keeping tokens and formatting intact .
- [x] nom                 High-performance parser-combinator library for binary or text grammars .
- [x] pest                PEG-based parser generator with a declarative grammar syntax .
- [x] lalrpop             LR(1)/LALR(1) parser generator that emits Rust code and separates lexer/grammar phases .
- [x] logos               Derives fast, table-driven lexers from simple #[derive] annotations .
- [x] rustc_lexer         The standalone UTF-8 lexer used by rustc; handy for Rust-like languages or tooling .
- [x] rowan               "Red-green" immutable syntax-tree library (used by rust-analyzer) that makes incremental reparsing easy.
- [x] codespan-reporting  Emits colourful, IDE-style diagnostic messages (file/line/column snippets, labels, notes).
- [x] ariadne             Error diagnostic reporting
- [x] miette              Higher-level diagnostics framework that layers on rich error contexts and suggestions.
- [x] id-arena            Simple, type-safe arena allocator that gives every node a compact numeric ID—great for ASTs or IRs.
- [x] bumpalo             Fast bump-allocation arena; ideal for short-lived compiler data structures.
- [x] indexmap            Hash map that preserves insertion order, useful for deterministic symbol tables.
- [x] smallvec            Vector that stores small lengths inline, reducing allocations in tight compiler loops.
- [x] bitflags            Generates type-safe bitmask structs for IR flags or access-modifier sets.
- [x] petgraph            Generic graph library: control-flow graphs, call graphs, dominance trees, etc., come for free.
- [x] cranelift           Stand-alone code generator you can embed as a back-end.
- [x] inkwell             Safe wrapper around LLVM's C API for building and optimising LLVM IR.
- [x] melior              MLIR Bindings
- [x] symbol_table
- [x] nom_locate          Location tracking for nom parsers
- [x] rustyline
- [ ] rustemo
- [ ] grmtools
- [x] chumsky             Parser combinator library with error recovery
- [ ] peg                 Inline PEG parser generator
- [x] combine
- [x] rust_sitter
- [x] codespan
- [x] winnow
